# Deep-Learning

These are Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course Materials given by deeplearning.ai and Andrew NG.

## Learning Objectives

In this course, you will learn the foundations of deep learning. When you finish this class, you will:

- Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
- Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks
- Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks
- Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture

This course also teaches you how Deep Learning actually works, rather than presenting only a cursory or surface-level description. So after completing it, you will be able to apply deep learning to a your own applications. If you are looking for a job in AI, after this course you will also be able to answer basic interview questions.

Programming Assignments:

- Python Basics with Numpy
- Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
- Planar data classification with one hidden layer
- Building your Deep Neural Network Step by Step 
- Deep Neural Network Application
